        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently in my first year of PhD at <a href="https://ic.zju.edu.cn/main.htm">College of IC, Zhejiang University</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/nidong">Dong Ni</a>. 
            I completed my bachelor's degree in <a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/api2017/index.psp">Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Zhejiang University</a> in 2024.</p>

        <h2>Statements</h2>
        <p>I am now interested in modeling, analyzing, and controlling multiscale systems. This involves SPDE, mean-field theory, and homogenous theory, as well as some control methods, scientific computing, machine learning, and multiscale analysis.</p>
        <p>Multiscale problems involve many aspects, and we can understand them from different perspectives. Roughly speaking, it is a multiscale problem of time and space, but the two are not in a separate relationship. We know that multiscale problems often range from microscopic (atomic) to macroscopic (fluid). In my opinion, I am more inclined to understand it as follows: even though there may be different phenomena (different constitutive equations) at various scales, the essence is that the most fundamental particles tend towards infinity in number. The phenomenon exhibited is a progressive behavior.</p>

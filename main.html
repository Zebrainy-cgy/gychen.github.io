        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently in my first year of PhD at <a href="https://ic.zju.edu.cn/main.htm">College of IC, Zhejiang University</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/nidong">Dong Ni</a>. 
            I completed my B.S. degree in <a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/api2017/index.psp">Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Zhejiang University</a> in 2024.</p>

        <h2>Statements</h2>
        <p>I am currently deeply interested in the topic of <strong>multiscale systems</strong>, both from a theoretical and applied perspective. My primary focus is on understanding the <strong>asymptotic behavior</strong> of these systems, and I am particularly keen on learning about theories related to <strong>mean-field theory</strong> and <strong>homogenization</strong>. These theoretical frameworks allow for a deeper analysis of multiscale systems across different scales.</p>

        <p><strong>Multiscale systems</strong> typically involve both <strong>temporal</strong> and <strong>spatial scales</strong>, which are often interdependent. Spatially, the scales range from the <strong>microscopic</strong> (atomic) level to the <strong>macroscopic</strong> (fluid) level. In <strong>microscopic systems</strong>, large particles exhibit <strong>Brownian motion</strong> due to collisions with smaller particles, which can be described by a <strong>Stochastic Ordinary Differential Equation (SODE)</strong>. As the number of particles tends to infinity, the behavior of the system can be captured by a <strong>Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE)</strong>. When the randomness of the system stabilizes, it can be described by a <strong>Partial Differential Equation (PDE)</strong>, modeling the macroscopic phenomena.</p>

        <p>I aim to analyze the progression from <strong>microscopic</strong> to <strong>macroscopic scales</strong> using <strong>asymptotic analysis</strong>, which is closely related to the principles of <strong>mean-field theory</strong>. Interestingly, this perspective can also be applied to <strong>neural networks</strong>. By considering each neuron as a particle, I hope to explore how the propagation of signals within a network can be understood through similar principles.</p>

        <p>This line of research involves a substantial amount of knowledge related to <strong>Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)</strong>, a field that I am passionate about. I am actively pursuing studies in this area, with the goal of applying these insights to the development of <strong>diffusion models</strong>.</p>

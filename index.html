            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently in my first year of PhD at <a
                    href="https://ic.zju.edu.cn/main.htm">College of IC,
                    Zhejiang
                    University</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a
                    href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/nidong">Dong
                    Ni</a>.
                I completed my B.S. degree in <a
                    href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/api2017/index.psp">Mathematics
                    and Applied
                    Mathematics, Zhejiang University</a> in 2024.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Statements</h2>
            <p>I am currently deeply interested in the topic of
                <strong>Multiscale Systems</strong>, with a particular focus
                on both their theoretical foundations and practical
                applications. Cause you know in the process of <strong>IC
                    manufacturing</strong>, etching, deposition and other
                processes are
                involved, which is a classic multiscale system. So my primary
                research interest lies in
                understanding the <strong>asymptotic behavior</strong> of
                these systems, with a strong emphasis on the theories of
                <strong>mean-field</strong> and
                <strong>homogenization</strong>.
                These frameworks provide essential tools for conducting a more
                comprehensive analysis of multiscale
                phenomena across various scales.
            </p>

            <p>Normally, <strong>Multiscale systems</strong> typically involve
                both
                <strong>temporal</strong> and <strong>spatial
                    scales</strong>, which are often interdependent. Spatially,
                the scales range from the
                <strong>microscopic</strong> (atomic) level to the
                <strong>macroscopic</strong> (fluid) level. In
                <strong>microscopic systems</strong>,
                large particles move follow <strong>Brownian
                    motion</strong> due to collisions of smaller particles,
                which can be described using
                <strong>Stochastic Ordinary Differential Equation
                    (SODE)</strong>. As the number of particles tends to
                infinity, the behavior of the system can be captured by
                <strong>Stochastic Partial Differential Equation
                    (SPDE)</strong>. When the randomness of the system
                stabilizes, it can be described by a <strong>Partial
                    Differential Equation (PDE)</strong>, which describe the
                macroscopic phenomena.
            </p>

            <p>
                My research aims to rigorously investigate the progression from
                <strong>microscopic</strong> to
                <strong>macroscopic</strong> scales through the application of
                <strong>asymptotic analysis</strong>, a
                method that aligns closely with the principles of
                <strong>mean-field theory</strong>. This approach has the
                potential to be extended beyond physical systems, offering a
                valuable perspective for the analysis of
                <strong>neural networks</strong>. By conceptualizing each neuron
                as a particle, I seek to explore how the
                propagation of signals within a network may be understood
                through analogous principles.
            </p>

            <p>
                The study of <strong>Stochastic Differential Equations
                    (SDEs)</strong> is integral to this research, as it
                underpins much of the theoretical framework required for
                analyzing multiscale systems. I am actively
                pursuing advanced studies in this area, with the goal of
                leveraging these insights to contribute to the
                development of <strong>diffusion models</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to this, I conducted research on the integration of
                classical numerical algorithms with
                <strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</strong>.
                However, I have come to recognize that the
                potential for further development of PINN-based methods is
                somewhat constrained. As a result, I have
                developed a keen interest in exploring the construction of more
                effective <strong>Neural Operators</strong>,
                as I believe that, in many aspects such as flexibility, neural
                operators offer distinct advantages over
                PINNs.
